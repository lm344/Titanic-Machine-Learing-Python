I have Analyzed the Titanic dataset in Python, in order to start with Machine Leaning algorithms.
I have tried different features from Python and implemented in the dataset
This repository has Python code along with, also please find some preliminary read me for Titanic Data Set.

Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):
1)Analysis of the features.
2)Finding any relations or trends considering multiple features.

Feature Engineering and Data Cleaning:
1)Adding any few features.
2)Removing redundant features.
3)Converting features into suitable form for modeling.


Types of Features
Categorical Features:
A categorical variable is one that has two or more categories and each value in that feature can be categorized by them. For example, gender is a categorical variable having two categories (male and female). Now we cannot sort or give any ordering to such variables. They are also known as Nominal Variables.
Categorical Features in the dataset: Sex, Embarked.
Ordinal Features:
An ordinal variable is similar to categorical values, but the difference between them is that we can have relative ordering or sorting between the values. For eg: If we have a feature like Height with values Tall, Medium, Short, then Height is an ordinal variable. Here we can have a relative sort in the variable.
Ordinal Features in the dataset: PClass
Continuous Feature:
A feature is said to be continuous if it can take values between any two points or between the minimum or maximum values in the features column.
Continuous Features in the dataset: Age
